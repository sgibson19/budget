# MyBudget.

MyBudget. is a webapp using the MERN stack, designed in Material-UI, and uses Speechly API for voice integration. I created it so I can see what am I'm spending my money on and most of all to aviod those "pending transactions" from bank accounts. By pending transactions, I mean when you purchased something with your debit/credit card, it sometimes doesn't show the correct date of the purchase. This issue led to create this webapp for my own personal use, now I know the specific dates of each purchase.
